🧠 Breast Cancer Prediction using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
📋 Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset and the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. It combines a machine learning backend with a Streamlit-based frontend that allows users to input tumor characteristics and receive real-time predictions.

🔍 Dataset
The project uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, which includes several numerical features that describe tumor characteristics such as:
•	Clump Thickness
•	Uniformity of Cell Size
•	Uniformity of Cell Shape
•	Marginal Adhesion
•	Single Epithelial Cell Size
•	Bare Nuclei
•	Bland Chromatin
•	Normal Nucleoli
•	Mitoses
