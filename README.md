Breast Cancer Prediction using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

📋 Project Overview:
This project aims to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset and the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The project includes both the machine learning backend and a Streamlit frontend where users can input tumor characteristics and get real-time predictions.

🔍 Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, which consists of several numerical features representing characteristics of tumors, such as:

Clump Thickness
Uniformity of Cell Size
Uniformity of Cell Shape
Marginal Adhesion
Single Epithelial Cell Size
Bare Nuclei
Bland Chromatin
Normal Nucleoli
Mitoses
The target variable (Class) indicates whether a tumor is benign (2) or malignant (4).

🚀 Features:
Machine Learning Model: The project uses a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to predict the tumor class (benign or malignant).
Frontend Application: A user-friendly web app built with Streamlit, where users can input tumor characteristics and receive predictions in real-time.
Model Tuning: The project explores different values of k (3 to 9) to find the optimal KNN model configuration.
🛠️ Project Components:
Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values using median imputation.
Feature scaling using StandardScaler.
Splitting the dataset into 80% training and 20% testing sets.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Model:

A KNN classifier is built using different values of k, with the best results achieved using k=6, k=7, and k=8.
Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score are used to evaluate model performance.
Streamlit Frontend:

A simple interface where users can input features like clump thickness, cell size/shape uniformity, bare nuclei, etc.
The app then predicts whether the tumor is benign or malignant using the saved KNN model.
📊 Model Results:
Best Model Accuracy: 97.86% (with k=6 and k=7)

Confusion Matrix for k=7:

    [[83 2] 
    [ 2 53]]
Precision: 97.65%

Recall: 97.65%

F1-Score: 97.65%

Null Accuracy: 60.71%

🤖 Technologies Used:
Python: For building the KNN model and data processing. Scikit-learn: For the KNN classifier, feature scaling, and evaluation metrics. Streamlit: For the frontend web app interface. Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and analysis. Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization

📌 Future Improvements:
Hyperparameter Tuning: Exploring advanced techniques like Grid Search for optimizing hyperparameters. Cross-validation: Implementing k-fold cross-validation for more robust model evaluation. Deployment: Deploying the Streamlit app on a cloud platform for broader accessibility.
